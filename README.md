LAB: TDD with Jest
This is the first lab in a three day series about schema and schema validation. For this lab, you'll learn to work with Jest (a new testing suite, more robust than QUnit) by writing functions to check a values type (is*) and functions to cast a value into another type (castTo*).

Before you begin
Refer to Getting Started in the lab submission instructions for complete setup, configuration, deployment, and submission instructions.

Getting Started
Looking in the starter_code folder, you'll see that there is a partial implementation of our validation "module".

In the root of that folder, you'll find a file called index.js that connects the validation module and attempts to run the functions imported from it.

In the __tests__ folder, you'll find a file called types.test.js that has the shells for the basic tests you need to write and make pass. See below for testing requirements.

In the lib folder, you'll find a file called types.js that wires in the validation module.

Requirements
USE TDD Practices

is* functions
isNumber
isString
isBoolean
isArray
isObject
isFunction
castTo*
castToNumber
castToString
castToBoolean
BONUS: castToArray
getCaster
getCaster(String) // return castToString
add your casters to getCaster
Testing
is*
Test that each function returns true for valid input
Test that each function returns false for invalid input
castTo*
Test that each function returns a correctly formated value from valid input
Test that each function throws an error from invalid input
Developer Implementation
Write a validation module that exports an object with functions. There are two kinds of functions you'll need to implement:

Check if a value is of a specified type is* function: isNumber, isString, etc.
Cast a value to a specified type castTo* function: castToNumber, castToString, etc.
Rubric
1 point per function (0.5 implementation / 0.5 test)
End User Implementation
Use the index.js file to validate objects using the imported functions from the module
console.log() the return values
